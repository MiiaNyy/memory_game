# Memory game

This project was a part of the Odin Project curriculum. <br/>
Projects goal was to practiced using React and especially React Hooks.
Because I was quite familiar already using hooks I also practiced how to use styled components.
## Description
In the game there is different number of cards on the game board, depending on the level that user wants to play. 
The goal is to click every card only once. The trick is that all of the cards are shown at once and after every click the order changes.
## What I learned
- Better understanding on React hooks 
- How to use Styled Components
  - What they are and how and where to use them
  - How to use conditional rendering in them
  - How to use props
- Creating an app mobile first
- How to add an animation to a element when elements state changes
- Changing webpack config files to better minify images
